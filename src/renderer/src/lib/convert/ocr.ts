/**
 * Reading text out of images.
 *
 * Two engines, chosen by the user per conversion:
 *
 *   cloud   — Google Gemini via an injected callback. Better accuracy, and it
 *             can describe charts and diagrams, not just transcribe text.
 *             Needs the user's own API key; the image is sent to Google.
 *   offline — Tesseract.js, with its engine and language model served from the
 *             app itself. No key, no network, nothing leaves the machine. Good
 *             on clean printed text, weak on anything else, and it cannot
 *             describe visual structure at all.
 *
 * Tesseract is imported lazily so its several megabytes of WASM only load if
 * the user actually chooses offline OCR.
